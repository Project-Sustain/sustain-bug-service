# Thing to know
- The `node_modules` folder is gitignored, so you need to run `npm install` the first time you clone this repo, and any time after you pull a branch which contains new npm dependencies
- Run `npm start` to launch
- When running this on the `lattice` machines, you'll need to forward `port 3000`
